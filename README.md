# Oaisis-Infobyte-Tasklist
This is the graphic design internship task I have for Oasis Infobyte. I was assigned to create logos, flyers, posters, business cards, magazine cover pages, and other materials in order to expand my knowledge of professional design and design layout. Additionally, I now know more about UI/UX design.
