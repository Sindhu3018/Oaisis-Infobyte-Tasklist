# Oaisis-Infobyte-Tasklist
This is the graphic design internship task I have for Oasis Infobyte. I was assigned to create logos, flyers, posters, business cards, magazine cover pages, and other materials in order to expand my knowledge of professional design and design layout. Additionally, I now know more about UI/UX design.
Digital flyers and posters need to be aesthetically pleasing and effectively convey a message to the general public. I have become acquainted with scaling and proper design layouts in digital platforms as I designed posters and flyers for marketing and public relations initiatives.
An organization's or brand's logo serves as a symbol of what it stands for. Subtly expressing their principles, they convey volumes about what businesses do. Professionals frequently use the Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) method when creating logos, emphasizing minimalism and the company's basic principles. This basic idea illustrates the importance of simplicity in graphic design.
Business cards are the foundation of every company's introduction strategy. In addition, they signify the company's branding. As a result, it's critical to convey the core of the business using creative typography.
Creating a magazine or brochure's visual identity and style is a challenging task. It incorporates a number of components, such as photography, graphic design, advertising, and visual representation. I have become familiar with the design standards and principles utilized in print media when working on a magazine design.
